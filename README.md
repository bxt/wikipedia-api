wikipeida-api gem
=================

Utility for interacting with the mediawiki api. 

It is based on schleyfox's very old [wikipedia-api gem](https://github.com/schleyfox/wikipedia-api).
A quote from this gem which should still apply:

    # Everything about it is incomplete and I promise that it will eat your kids
    # and/or small furry woodland creatures.  These things happen.

For more informaition see [rdocs](http://bxt.github.com/wikipedia-api/) or source comments.
