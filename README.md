wikipeida-api gem
=================

Utility for interacting with the [mediawiki api](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php). 

It is based on schleyfox's very old [wikipedia-api gem](https://github.com/schleyfox/wikipedia-api).
A quote from this gem which should still apply:

    # Everything about it is incomplete and I promise that it will eat your kids
    # and/or small furry woodland creatures.  These things happen.

It kinda works though. 

Installing
----------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wikipedia-api', git: 'git://github.com/bxt/wikipedia-api.git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

The gem is currently not in the rubygems.org repository. 

Usage
-----
