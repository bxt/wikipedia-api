However, the precise relationship of these terms is not known with certainty, and several anecdotal theories have been advanced to identify them.\n\nThe etymology of ''foo'' is explored in the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) RFC 3092, which gives the earliest documented use as being in the 1930s comic ''[[Smokey Stover]]'' by [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], where it is used as a nonsense word.<ref name=\"jargon\">\u201c[http:\/\/catb.org\/jargon\/html\/F\/foo.html foo]\u201d, ''[http:\/\/catb.org\/jargon\/html\/index.html The Jargon File]''<\/ref> Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]], meaning \"good luck\".<ref>\"[http:\/\/www.smokey-stover.com\/history.html The History of Bill Holman]\", [http:\/\/www.smokey-stover.com\/ Smokey-Stover.com], Smokey Stover LLC \u2013 article by nephew of Bill Holman<\/ref><ref>\"[http:\/\/members.aol.com\/EOCostello\/ Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion]\"<\/ref> This is presumably as a transliteration of the [[fu character]] (f\u00fa, \u798f), which is a common character for fortune, and figurines of the trio of eponymous male \"star gods\" [[Fu Lu Shou|''F\u00fa, L\u00f9, Sh\u00f2u'']] are common in Chinese communities, as illustrated at right; compare [[Fu Manchu]], fictional character popular in the 1930s. ''Smokey Stover'' ran 1935\u201373, and continued to feature ''foo'' prominently, as on the front of the \"foomobile\" illustrated in the cover at right. The word ''foo'' became very popular in the 1930s, and also appeared in other cartoons including the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons of [[Bob Clampett]] such as ''[[The Daffy Doc]]'' and ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'' (both 1938, with [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]]), and in other comic strips such as ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''.\n\nFrom there, the term migrated into military slang, where it merged with FUBAR.<ref name=\"rfc3092\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc3092.txt|title=Etymology of \"Foo\"|author=D.

The use of ''foo'' in hacker and eventually in programming context may have begun in MIT's [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC). In the complex model system, there were [[scram]] switches located at numerous places around the room that could be thrown if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word \"FOO\"; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called \"Foo switches\". Because of this, an entry in the 1959 Dictionary of the TMRC Language went something like this: \"FOO: The first syllable of the misquoted sacred chant phrase '[[Om mani padme hum|foo mane padme hum]].' Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http:\/\/www.computer-dictionary-online.org\/?q=foo\n|title=Computer Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org<\/ref>\n\nOne book{{which?|date=November 2010}} describing the MIT train room describes two buttons by the door: labelled foo and bar. These were general purpose buttons and were often re-purposed for whatever fun idea the MIT hackers had at the time, hence the adoption of foo and bar as general purpose variable names. An entry in the \"Abridged Dictionary of the TMRC Language\" states \"Multiflush: stop-all-trains-button. Next best thing to the red door button. Also called FOO. Displays \"FOO\" on the clock when used.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/tmrc.mit.edu\/dictionary.html|title=Abridged Dictionary of the TMRC Language|publisher=[[MIT]]}}<\/ref>\n\nThe term ''foobar'' was propagated through computer science circles in the 1960s and early 1970s by system manuals from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n''Foobar'' was used as a variable name in the [[Fortran]] code of ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1977 Crowther and Woods version). The variable FOOBAR was used to contain the player's progress in saying the magic phrase \"Fee Fie Foe Foo\".\n\n==Usage in code==\nThe terms are very often used in programming examples, much like the [[Hello World]] program is commonly used as an introduction.  For example, ''foo'' and ''bar'' might be used to illustrate a simple string concatenation:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n\/* C code *\/\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n   char *foo = \"Hello\";\n   char *bar = \"World!\";\n   printf(\"%s %s\\n\", foo, bar);\n\n   return 0;\n}\n<\/source>\n\n<source lang=\"php\">\n\/* PHP code *\/\n\n$foo = 'Hello';\n$bar = array($foo, ' ', 'world', '!');\n\necho implode('', $bar);\n<\/source>\n\n<source lang=\"java\">\n\/* Java code *\/\n\npublic class Foobar\n{\n  public static void main(String[] args)\n  {\n    String foo = \"Hello\";\n    String bar = \"World!\";\n    \n    System.out.println(foo + \" \" + bar);\n  }\n}\n<\/source>\nAdditional examples of the use of ''foo'' and ''bar'' in code are given in the entry on [[metasyntactic variables#Programming language examples|metasyntactic variables]].\n\n==Usage in culture==\n''$foo'' is the name of a [[Perl]] programming magazine,<ref>[http:\/\/foo-magazin.de\/ Foo-magazin.de] {{de icon}}<\/ref> and [[Foo Camp]] is an annual [[hacker convention]].\n\nDuring the ''[[United States v.
